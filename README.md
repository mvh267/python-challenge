# Python Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll #
# Overview #
In this project, I applied Python scripting to solve real-world data analysis problems in two distinct challenges: PyBank (financial data analysis) and PyPoll (election data analysis). This task involved extensive data manipulation, calculation, and presentation using Python.

# PyBank Challenge #
## Achievements ##
- Data Analysis: Analyzed financial data from budget_data.csv, consisting of "Date" and "Profit/Losses" columns.
- Key Metrics Computation: Calculated total months included in the dataset, net total amount of "Profit/Losses", average change in "Profit/Losses", and identified the greatest increase and decrease in profits.
- Results Presentation: Developed a script to print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
## Key Results ##
- Total Months: 86
- Total Profit/Losses: $22,564,198
- Average Monthly Change: $-8,311.11
- Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1,862,002)
- Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1,825,558)
# PyPoll Challenge #
## Achievements ##
- Vote Counting: Processed election data from election_data.csv with columns "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".
- Election Analysis: Computed the total number of votes cast, percentage and total number of votes each candidate won, and determined the election winner.
- Reporting: Scripted to output election results both to the terminal and a text file.
## Key Results ##
- Total Votes: 369,711
- Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85,213 votes)
- Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272,892 votes)
- Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11,606 votes)
- Winner: Diana DeGette
# Technical Implementation #
- Utilized Python's CSV module for data reading and parsing.
- Employed lists, dictionaries, and loops for data storage and manipulation.
- Ensured clean, commented, and well-structured code for readability and maintainability.
- Practiced efficient debugging and testing to ensure accurate results.
